  <h2>The <em>Root</em> Certificate</h2>

<p class="lead">
The trust anchor for digital certificate infrastructure are the Root Certificate Authorities (CA).
</p>
<p>
  A certificate authority can issue multiple certificates in the form of a tree structure.
  A root certificate is the top-most certificate of the tree, the private key of
  which is used to "sign" other certificates. All certificates immediately below
  the root certificate inherit the trustworthiness of the root certificate â€“ a
  signature by a root certificate is somewhat analogous to "notarizing" an
  identity in the physical world. Certificates further down the tree also
  depend on the trustworthiness of the intermediates (often known as
  "subordinate certification authorities").</p>
<p>
  For the purposes of easily creating and managing certificates at DST, this
  site uses a self-signed <em>root</em> certificate.  This certificate
  will need to be deployed to each software system and user-agent which will rely upon
  the server certificates created by this Certificate Manager.</p>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

<p>Download the root <a href="{{ .Site.Other.Url }}/static/dst-k8s-root.pem ">certificate.</a>
Then proceed to the following instructions depending upon how you plan
to access the server.  For example, if your micro-service will be accessing
another micro-service whose certificate was generated by this site, then
use one of the operating system specific instructions below.  If you only want to
access a service using a <em>user agent</em>,
also known as a 'browser', then follow the appropriate browser installation path.</p>
